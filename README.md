### The Colour Language Game

This Python Notebook aims to analyse a dataset from an online experiment that consists of thousands of colour naming responses mapped to RGB triplets by thousands of participants against the X11 reference dataset. The first dataset is being used to simualate the responses of players of a Colour Naming Game, in which a fictional character called Alice asks the players to identify the corresponding RGB values for a given English colour term. This notebook tests the game by building a synthetic player with collective intelligence, called Bob, which uses and performing analysis on the colour naming dataset.

The methods section of this notebook includes a range of functions for analysing datasets with pandas, such as calculating the Euclidean distance between two arrays. In the Results section I use these functions to create a program called Bob which simulates the collective intelligence of a player playing a Colour Language Game. Bob uses the functions established in methods to analysis these datasets and present the findings in a performance report that includes visualisations. Finally in the conclusions section, I discuss the ethical ramifications of this analysis and the potential unintended consequences of poor use.
